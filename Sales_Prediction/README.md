## Sales Prediction using Python

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on.

Typically, a product and service-based business always needs their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product.

This project demonstrates how to build a simple machine learning model in Python to predict sales based on advertising data.

## Dataset

Download the dataset from here:
Sales Prediction Dataset

(Or use any CSV file with columns like TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales)

## Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run the script:

python sales_prediction.py
